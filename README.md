# Rest Mocker

Rest mocker is annotation based a lightweight mock rest api library for Android. It is compatable with OkHttp. Library lets you specify which responses to return. You can check [demo application](https://github.com/emrebehadir/rest-mocker-sample).

## Installation

In your project's `build.gradle`:
```gradle
allprojects {
    repositories {
        ....
        maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
    }
}
```
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.emrebehadir:rest-mocker:0.0.1-alpha'
}
```

## Quick Start

### Initialize Library

Library must be initialize with `application resources`. It reads your raw response files.

```kotlin
    RestMocker.initialize(resources)
```

### Add OkHttpClient Interceptor

RestMockerInterceptor analyze your rest call and decide which api will be mock.

```kotlin
    val httpClient = OkHttpClient.Builder()
                .addInterceptor(RestMockerInterceptor())
                .build()
```

### Applying an Annotation

`@Mocker` specify which function will return mock response.

```kotlin
    @Mocker(rawResourceId = R.raw.todo)
    @GET("/todos/1")
    fun getTodo(): Call<ApiResponse>
```

### Where Is The Location Of Mock Response ?

Put your files to res/raw.

```
    App
    |
    -> res
      |
      -> sample_response.tx
      -> ...   
```
